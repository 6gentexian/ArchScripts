#
#
#  This suite of scripts provides basic config files for an ARCH linux system.
#  Also, there are two scripts that work together to improve the package manager,
#  pacman.
#
#
#  FILES
#    .inputrc - From LFS: Inputrc deals with the mapping of the keyboard for
#      certain situations. This file is the start-up file used by readline,
#      the input related library used by bash and most other shells.
#    inputrc - System version of .inputrc
#
#    .Xauthority - From linuxquestions.org:  It's a file found in each user's
#      home dir that is used to store credentials used by xauth for
#      authentication of X sessions.
#
#    .xinitrc - From the Arch wiki:   This file is a shell script read by xinit
#      and by its front-end startx. It is mainly used to execute desktop
#      environments, window managers and other programs when starting the
#      X server.
#    xinitrc - System file
#
#    .Xresources - From the Arch wiki; This file is a user-level configuration
#      dotfile. It can be used to set X resources, i.e. configuration parameters
#      for X client applications.  They can do many operations, including:
#      defining terminal colours, configuring terminal preferences, setting DPI,
#      antialiasing, hinting and other X font settings, changing the Xcursor
#      theme, theming xscreensaver, altering preferences on low-level
#      X applications.
#
#    .Xdefaults - although the use of this file is deprecated in Arch, setting
#      user specific configs (e,g, for a laptop vs a desktop for the size and
       placement of an xterm window) may com in handy.
#      .Xdefaults-curly - host specific file (Acer chromebook)
#      .Xdefaults-moe - host specfici file (desktop)
#
#
#    update.pacman.sh - This script will:
#      Update/sync repos and packages downloaded from Arch
#      Create files containing the names of all packages installed locally
#
#      All generic functions used are in .bashrc. They are commented out at
#        the end of this file if you don't want to place them in your startup file.
#      $TMPDIR is set in .bash_profile
#
#      reflector.sh - bash script replicating original code written in python?
#                     I can't remember where I got this but kudos to the author.
#
#
#  DEPENDENCIES
#    curl 7.47.1
#    sed (GNU sed) 4.2.2
#    Pacman v5.0.1 - libalpm v10.0.1
#    xrdb 1.1.0
#    xorg-xinit 1.3.4-3
#    xorg-xauth 1.0.9-1
#    readline 6.3.008-3
#
#
#  USE:  All of the dot files are placed in ~/ , no sourcing etc is needed.
#        For pacman:
#          Place reflector.sh and update.pacman.sh somewhere in your
#            $PATH, e.g. ~/bin
#          $ ./update.pacman.sh
#
#
#  NB: All generic functions used are in .bashrc. They are commented out at
#      the end of this file if you don't want to place them in your startup file.
#      $TMPDIR is set in .bash_profile or .bashrc
#
#
#  TODOs:   Add ability to update private repos vs ABS
