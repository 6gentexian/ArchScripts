1413143198 <p>To circumvent a conflicting files issue, manual intervention is required <strong>only if package <code>java-common</code> is installed</strong>. This can be checked with the following command:</p> 
<pre><code>$ pacman -Q java-common 
java-common ... 
</code></pre> 
<p>If so, please run the following <strong>prior</strong> to upgrading:</p> 
<pre><code># archlinux-java unset 
# pacman -Sydd --asdeps java-runtime-common 
:: java-runtime-common and java-common are in conflict. Remove java-common? [y/N] y 
# archlinux-java fix 
</code></pre> 
<p>You can then go ahead and upgrade:</p> 
<pre><code># pacman -Su 
</code></pre> 
<p>Please note that new package <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/java-common/"><code>java-runtime-common</code></a> does <strong>not</strong> use nor support forcing <code>JAVA_HOME</code> as former package <code>java-common</code> did. See the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java">Java wiki page</a> for more info.</p>
1414013350 <p>Microcode on Intel CPUs is no longer loaded automatically, as it needs 
to be loaded very early in the boot process. This requires adjustments 
in the bootloader. If you have an Intel CPU, please follow <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode#Enabling_Intel_Microcode_Updates">the 
instructions in the 
wiki</a>.</p>
1418004794 <p>The upgrade to gnupg-2.1 ported the pacman keyring to a new upstream format but in the process rendered the local master key unable to sign other keys. This is only an issue if you ever intend to customize your pacman keyring. We nevertheless recommend all users fix this by generating a fresh keyring.</p> 
<p>In addition, we recommend installing haveged, a daemon that generates system entropy; this speeds up critical operations in cryptographic programs such as gnupg (including the generation of new keyrings).</p> 
<p>To do all the above, run as root:</p> 
<pre><code>pacman -Syu haveged 
systemctl start haveged 
systemctl enable haveged 
 
rm -fr /etc/pacman.d/gnupg 
pacman-key --init 
pacman-key --populate archlinux 
</code></pre>
1418299508 <p>The way local CA certificates are handled has changed. If you have added any locally trusted certificates:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Move /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/*.crt to 
 /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/</li> 
<li>Do the same with all manually-added /etc/ssl/certs/*.pem files 
 and rename them to *.crt</li> 
<li>Instead of <code>update-ca-certificates</code>, run <code>trust extract-compat</code></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Also see <code>man 8 update-ca-trust</code> and <code>trust --help</code>.</p>
1421775410 <p>For consistency with upstream naming, the lirc-utils package was renamed to lirc. The wpc8769l kernel drivers were dropped and can be obtained by installing <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lirc-wpc8769l/">lirc-wpc8769l from the AUR</a>.</p> 
<p>Note that 0.9.2 is a major release and comes along with several upstream and packaging changes. In particular, the <code>irexec.service</code> systemd unit was removed. Please edit and copy the template <code>/usr/share/lirc/contrib/irexec.service</code> if you want to keep using that service.</p>
1422267613 <p>The KDE Software Collection has been updated to KDE Applications 14.12.</p> 
<p>The KDE developers have started porting their software to KDE Frameworks and Qt 5. For a list of the software that has been ported see <a href="https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-14.12.0.php">the announcement</a>.</p> 
<p>When a KDE Frameworks port of a KDE application is considered stable, it is released with KDE Applications and development and bug fixes are no longer applied to the Qt4/KDE4 version. This means that as ported versions of applications are released, we will switch to the newer version. At the same time, we are getting rid of KDE module prefixes (e.g. <em>kdebase-konsole -&amp;gt; konsole</em>).</p> 
<p>The result of this transition is that some packages will be using Qt5 and some will be using Qt4. We are working hard to make the transition smooth for KDE4 users, but things might look different depending on your configuration. Please adjust themes and colors as necessary for the two toolkits. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KDE#Personalization">the wiki</a> for help. 
We also recommend switching to Plasma 5.2 which will be released this week.</p> 
<p>Please report upstream bugs to the KDE bugzilla. Feel free to CC me.</p>
1424005606 <p>The new version comes with the following changes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>following ustream, xf86-video-modesetting is now provided with xorg-server package.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p>These packages are deprecated and moved to AUR, some are replaced by modesetting driver: 
xf86-video-ast, xf86-video-cirrus, xf86-video-geode, xf86-video-mga, xf86-video-sisimedia, xf86-video-v4l</p> 
</li> 
</ul>
1431761988 <p>Some modules have been split from the <code>pulseaudio</code> package to avoid having modules with missing dynamic libraries. Please check which modules you need and reinstall them.</p> 
<p>The split out modules are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-bluetooth</code>: Bluetooth (Bluez) support</li> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-equalizer</code>: Equalizer sink (qpaeq)</li> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-gconf</code>: GConf support (paprefs)</li> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-jack</code>: JACK sink, source and jackdbus detection</li> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-lirc</code>: Infrared (LIRC) volume control</li> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-xen</code>: Xen paravirtual sink</li> 
<li><code>pulseaudio-zeroconf</code>: Zeroconf (Avahi/DNS-SD) support</li> 
</ul>
1431880040 <p>Puppet 4 has been released and breaks compatibility with version 3. Therefore users will need to upgrade a server to Puppet 4 before updating their clients. Note that if only a Puppet 4 server is available, Puppet 3 clients will not work. Also a number of locations for things have changed including the config, manifest and module files. You will need to follow upgrade instructions for your servers and clients:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.0/reference/upgrade_server.html">https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.0/reference/upgrade_server.html</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.0/reference/upgrade_agent.html">https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.0/reference/upgrade_agent.html</a></li> 
</ul>
1432326745 <p>Recent Linux kernels (4.0.2+, LTS 3.14.41+), pushed to the [core] repository in the past couple of weeks, suffered from a bug that can cause data corruption on file systems mounted with the <code>discard</code> option and residing on software RAID 0 arrays. Even if <code>discard</code> is not specified, the <code>fstrim</code> command can also trigger this bug. (<strong>If you do not use software RAID 0 or the <code>discard</code> option, then this issue does not affect you.</strong>)</p> 
<p>The issue has been addressed in the <code>linux 4.0.4-2</code> and <code>linux-lts 3.14.43-2</code> updates. Due to the nature of the bug, however, it is likely that data corruption has already occurred on systems running the aforementioned kernels. It is strongly advised to verify the integrity of affected file systems using <code>fsck</code> and/or restore their data from known good backups.</p> 
<p>For further information please read the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/21/167">LKML post</a> by Holger Kiehl, the <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Linux-4-EXT4-RAID-Issue-Found">related article</a> on Phoronix, as well as the <a href="http://git.neil.brown.name/?p=md.git;a=commitdiff;h=a81157768a00e8cf8a7b43b5ea5cac931262374f">proposed fix</a> that was backported to the Arch kernels.</p>
1439529002 <p>In light of recently discovered vulnerabilities, the new <code>openssh-7.0p1</code> 
release deprecates keys of <code>ssh-dss</code> type, also known as DSA keys. See 
the 
<a href="http://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-announce/2015-August/000122.html">upstream announcement</a> 
for details.</p> 
<p>Before updating and restarting <code>sshd</code> on a remote host, make sure you do 
not rely on such keys for connecting to it. To enumerate DSA keys 
granting access to a given account, use:</p> 
<pre><code> grep ssh-dss ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
</code></pre> 
<p>If you have any, ensure you have alternative means of logging in, such 
as key pairs of a different type, or password authentication.</p> 
<p>Finally, host keys of <code>ssh-dss</code> type being deprecated too, you might 
have to confirm a new fingerprint (for a host key of a different type) 
when connecting to a freshly updated server.</p>
1442781067 <p>The packages <code>systemd</code> 226-1 plus <code>dbus</code> 1.10.0-3 now launch <em>dbus-daemon</em> once per user; all sessions of a user will share the same D-Bus "session" bus. The <em>pam_systemd</em> module ensures that the right <code>DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</code> is set at login.</p> 
<p>This also permits dbus-daemon to defer to systemd for activation instead of spawning server processes itself. However, currently this is not commonly used for session services (as opposed to system services).</p> 
<p><em>kdbus</em> will only support this model, so this is also an opportunity to iron out some bugs and make a future transition to kernel buses easier. Please let us know of any issues.</p>
1444291848 <p>Update: All fixed now.</p> 
<p>I just installed a kernel update on our rsync and mail server and it seems we have broken hardware so it is unable to reboot right now. Mailing lists are running on a different system however you need to use the <code>lists.archlinux.org</code> domain rather than <code>archlinux.org</code>. So for arch-general you'd use <code>arch-general@lists.archlinux.org</code>. Mails sent to the normal domain will go through once the server is up again.</p> 
<p>The rsync master will stay unavailable for now.</p> 
<p>I've asked the hoster to look into the issue, but I can't currently estimate when I'll get a reply/fix.</p> 
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience, 
Florian</p>
1447418572 <p>Xorg 1.18.0 is entering [testing] with the following changes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>You can now choose between <code>xf86-input-evdev</code> and <code>xf86-input-libinput</code>.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p><code>xf86-input-aiptek</code> will not be updated and will be removed when xorg-1.18.0 is moved to [extra]</p> 
</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Update: Nvidia drivers are now compatible with xorg-1.18.0 (ABI 20)</p>
1449730114 <p>GCC 5.x contains libstdc++ with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html">dual ABI</a> support and we have now switched to the new ABI.</p> 
<p>While the old C++ ABI is still available, it is recommended that you build all non-repo packages to have the new ABI. This is particularly important if they link to another library built against the new ABI. You can get a list of packages to rebuild using the following shell script:</p> 
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash 
 
while read pkg; do 
 mapfile -t files &amp;lt; &amp;lt;(pacman -Qlq $pkg | grep -v /$) 
 grep -Fq libstdc++.so.6 "${files[@]}" &amp;lt;&amp;amp;- 2&amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo $pkg 
done &amp;lt; &amp;lt;(pacman -Qmq) 
</code></pre>

1449914655 <p>Since the KDE 4 desktop has been unmaintained for several months and it's becoming increasingly difficult to support two versions of Plasma, we are removing it from our repositories. Plasma 5.5 has just been released and should be stable enough to replace it.</p> 
<p>KDE 4 installations will not be automatically upgraded to Plasma 5. However, we recommend all users to upgrade or switch to a maintained alternative as soon as possible, since any future update may break the KDE 4 desktop without prior notice. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KDE#Upgrading_from_Plasma_4_to_5">the wiki</a> for instructions on how to upgrade to Plasma 5.</p>
1451747621 <p>Packages of the new major version of PHP have been released into the stable repositories. Besides the new <a href="http://php.net/archive/2015.php#id2015-12-03-1">PHP 7 features</a> there are the following packaging changes. In general the package configuration is now closer to what was intended by the PHP project.
